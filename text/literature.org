/P_es/ is short for esophageal pressure, usually referring to the peak negative pressure during an attempted inspiration. Most of these articles were discovered by recursively following the references of Vandenbussche & al., 2015, and Exar & al., 1999.

These updates are based on acomprehensive review of the evidence on the diagnostic testing approaches for adults with obstructive sleep apneawith polysomnography.  The clinical practice guideline is an essential update to the recommendations found in this practice parameter document:Kapur VK, Auckley DH, Chowdhuri S, Kuhlmann DC, Mehra R, Ramar K, Harrod CG.
